## Project Summary

This backend project includes functionalities such as:

- **Authentication and Authorization**:
  - User registration and login.
  - Secure password handling using **bcrypt**.
  - Authentication with **JWT** (access and refresh tokens).
- **Video Management**:
  - Upload, update, and delete videos.
  - Like, dislike, comment, and reply on videos.
  - View video details.
- **User Engagement**:
  - Subscribe and unsubscribe to channels.
  - Track user subscriptions and interactions.
- **Standard Practices**:
  - Implements best practices for token management, error handling, and database interactions.
  - Secure and scalable structure for future expansion.
